        <p class="about-int">
          In 2005, with immense courage and the collective savings of the
          family, the first MR Restaurant opened its doors on No.72 Kamaraj road, Thoothukudi. It was a modest space with just 42 tables,
          but it was built on an immovable foundation: authentic recipes,
          generational wisdom, and respect for every single guest. The early
          days were powered by sheer passion. Mr.Mathi would
          be at the market at dawn, selecting the freshest produce and spices.
          The entire family would grind masalas by hand, slow-cook gravies for
          hours, and personally welcome each customer. Word spread quickly. We
          weren't just a restaurant; we were an extension of that warm, familial
          kitchen where everyone was treated like family.
